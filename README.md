# ETL-Project-Chicago-Traffice-Lights

In this project, I worked with a few others to practice the Extract, Transfer, and Load (ETL) procedure for processing data. We found data on Chicago Red Light Violations and Weather on Kaggle, cleaned and merged the two datasets, and saved the data into a SQL database.
